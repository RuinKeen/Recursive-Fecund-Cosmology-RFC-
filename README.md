# Recursive-Fecund-Emergentism-Physics-
Core Postulates of RFC-Se

1. **Physical Recursion:** Fundamental physical laws are expressions of recursive patterns and emergent dynamics.

2. **Scale-Invariant Emergence:** Recursive fecundity manifests as emergent phenomena across all physical scales.

3. **Nonlinear Feedback:** Recursive causal loops produce nonlinear physical behaviors and complexity.

4. **Quantum-Cosmic Continuity:** Quantum and cosmological processes are recursively linked in a unified framework.
