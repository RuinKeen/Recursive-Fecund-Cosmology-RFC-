Core Postulates of RFC-P

1. **Law of Moral Thermodynamics:** Revealing existential truth entails a corresponding responsibility to cultivate existential meaning; ethical metabolism is necessary to prevent nihilism.

2. **Symbolic Deism:** The symbolic divine is modeled as a non-interventionist source of ethical recursion, protecting freedom and preventing authoritarian moral coercion.

3. **Ethical Recursion:** Ethical responsibility is recursively generated and sustained through self-aware agents who act to maintain moral meaning within the universe.
