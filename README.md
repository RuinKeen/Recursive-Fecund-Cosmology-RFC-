# Recursive Fecund Cosmology (RFC)

RFC is a unifying philosophical and scientific framework proposing that reality self-generates recursively through cycles of generative complexity. It is split into two major branches:

- **RFC-S**: Scientific - focused on natural recursion, black hole cosmogenesis, and information dynamics.
- **RFC-P**: Poetic/Philosophical - explores symbolic, ethical, and metaphysical implications without dogma.

This repo documents the evolving architecture of RFC, including its axioms, causal maps, conceptual branches, and potential testable predictions.

**Status**: Work in Progress. Contributions by the original author. License status (Â©)All Rights Reserved.
