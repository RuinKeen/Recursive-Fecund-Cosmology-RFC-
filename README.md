# Recursive-Fecund-Science-Branch-
Core Postulates of RFC-S

1. **Recursive Fecundity:** Reality is fundamentally recursive, generating new structures through infinite, self-similar fecundity.

2. **Emergent Generativity:** Complex systems emerge from iterative, self-organizing recursive units across multiple scales.

3. **Causal Recursion:** Cause-effect relationships operate recursively across nested dimensions and scales.

4. **Existential Grounding:** Scientific inquiry grounds the recursive framework in observable, testable phenomena.
