RFC-P: Poetic / Philosophical Branch

This branch represents the poetic, symbolic, and ethical dimensions of RFC.
Central concept: The Law of Moral Thermodynamics.

RFC-P does not promote literal theism or atheism but a symbolic non-interventionist deism inspired by Simone Weil. It argues for ethical meaning in the face of existential truth.
