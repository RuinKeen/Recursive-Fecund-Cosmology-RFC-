RFC Core Theory

RFC (Recursive Fecund Cosmology) proposes that the universe is self-generative via recursive cycles. Instead of a simulation, reality emerges through black hole fecundity, where each universe births the next.

Core Concepts:
- No external programmer or deity is required.
- Recursive causality, not divine causality.
- Axioms and metaphysical structure [to be filled in].
