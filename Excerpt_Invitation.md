Recursive Fecund Cosmology (RFC) - Summarized Excerpt

Q: Is this universe a simulation?

Simulation Theory says:
The universe is like a computer simulation controlled by an external programmer or entity. Reality “renders” only when observed, implying a designer outside the system. This perspective raises questions about who or what created the programmer.

Observed Common Cited Indicators:
(Atheist vs Monotheist Vehicle)  
Simulation Theory = "Deist"/Creator worldview, dressed digitally.

Fibonacci Sequence = Sign of Coded Reality or the Work of God.

Fine-tuning of the Universe = Programmer or God.

Déjà vu = Simulation Glitch or Godly Revelation.]

The Double Slit Experiment = implies a dependence of reality based on observation.

Deterministic Variant = No Free Will.
Fails to explain Quantum Indeterminacy, Falls into Nihilism, and implies infinitely complex simulator.


A: No, not in the traditional sense.

Recursive Fecund Cosmology (RFC):
The universe is not a simulation by an outside agent. Instead, reality self-generates through recursive cycles and black holes create new universes, information is conserved and recycled, and complexity grows naturally. Observation, and ("quantum weirdness") are emergent properties of recursive information systems inside the universe itself, not because of an external mind-rendering process.

Key distinction:
Simulation theory depends on a creator/programmer; RFC depends on naturally recursive generative processes without external designers.

(RFC maintains openness to metaphysical possibilities keeping it ajar, and insists on the necessity of ethics/meaning to be built independently regardless of any definitive metaphysical conclusion.)

Major Questions we address(Q&A):

1.
Why is quantum mechanics weird (like the double slit experiment)?
— It reflects the properties of a self-referential recursive information system, and not a rendered game.

2.
Why does the universe have order and complexity?
— Because recursion and fecundity drive continual generative growth.

3.
Where does consciousness fit in?
— It emerges from nested recursive processes within life and cosmic systems.

Still intrigued?:
If you are interested in the ongoing development of RFC, it is being formalized into a scientific and philosophical framework, with plans for future testable predictions.
